You are going to build a Rock, Paper, Scissors game.  
You will use randomisation and lists to simulate the classic hand game between the user and the computer.

📄 [View the code](solution.py)

#### 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Python modules  
- `random` module (`randint`)  
- Lists and indexing  
- Conditional logic and comparison  
- User input validation

#### 📝 Instructions
1. Create a list of game choices: Rock, Paper, and Scissors.  
2. Ask the user to input their choice (0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, 2 for Scissors).  
3. Use the `random` module to let the computer randomly select a choice.  
4. Compare both choices using conditions to determine the winner.  
5. Display the choices and result (Win, Lose, or Draw).  
6. Handle invalid inputs gracefully.
