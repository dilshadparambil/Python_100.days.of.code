### Day 3: Treasure Island

Your goal today is to build a "Choose Your Own Adventure" game.  
Using conditional logic and flow control, this text-based game leads the player on a short adventure to find a hidden treasure.

#### 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`)  
- Code blocks and indentation  
- Scope and nesting logic

#### 📝 Instructions
1. Greet the player and set the adventure theme.
2. Present choices using `input()` and handle the response with `if` conditions.
3. Guide the user through different paths based on their inputs:
   - Left or Right
   - Swim or Wait
   - Red, Blue, or Yellow door
4. Use nested conditionals to follow the flowchart logic.
5. Print game-over or victory messages accordingly.
