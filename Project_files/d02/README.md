- Data types
- Arithmetic operations
- Type checking
- Type conversions (str(), int(), float())
- Flooring & rounding

#### 📝 Instructions
1. Ask the user for the total bill amount.
2. Ask for the tip percentage they want to give.
3. Ask how many people to split the bill between.
4. Calculate how much each person should pay.
5. Format the result to 2 decimal places for currency.

#### 💡 Example
```text
If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip:
(150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6

After formatting:
Each person pays: 33.60
```
