## Day 65: Web Design School – Café Webpage 🎨☕  
For this project, a **café landing page** was designed using **Canva**:  
The page highlights the café’s story, offerings (food, pool, rooms), and a **contact section** with modern, aesthetic visuals. The design emphasizes balance, readability, and emotional appeal to create a strong online presence for a café.
