### 📝 Instructions

1. **Set Up Your HTML File**  
   - Create a new file named `index.html`.  
   - Add a basic HTML boilerplate with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.  

2. **Add a Title and Subheading**  
   - Use `<h1>` for the page title (e.g., “The Best Movies According to Dilshad”).  
   - Use `<h2>` for a subtitle (e.g., “My top 3 movies of all time”).  

3. **Add a Horizontal Divider**  
   - Use `<hr />` to visually separate the heading section from the movie list.  

4. **List Your Movies**  
   - For each movie, use:  
     - `<h3>` for the movie title and release year.  
     - `<p>` for a short description and key details.  
     - `<b>` tags to highlight key information like Release Date, Director, etc.  
     - `<br />` for spacing between lines.

💡 **Extra Challenge**:
- Add a movie poster using the `<img>` tag.  
- Turn each movie title into a clickable link to its IMDB page using `<a href="">`.  
- Create an ordered or unordered list (`<ol>`, `<ul>`) of honorable mentions.  
- Add a footer to the webpage.
