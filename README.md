### Day 1: Band Name Generator
A simple project that generates a band name using the city you grew up in and your pet’s name.

```python
print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator!")
city = input("Which city did you grow up in?\n")
pet = input("What is the name of your pet?\n")
print("Your band name could be: " + city + " " + pet)
